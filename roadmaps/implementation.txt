================================================================================
NOTES & BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

Code Quality:
- Follow C99 standard strictly
- Use consistent naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables)
- Comment all public APIs with purpose, parameters, and return values
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines when possible)
- Minimize global state
- Use const correctness
- Check all return values and handle errors gracefully

Git Workflow:
- Use feature branches for new features
- Write clear commit messages (present tense, imperative mood)
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use PR reviews for quality control
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

Testing:
- Write tests before fixing bugs (TDD when possible)
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Run tests before every commit
- Never commit broken tests

Performance:
- Profile before optimizing
- Optimize only hot paths
- Maintain readability over micro-optimizations
- Document performance-critical sections

Documentation:
- Keep README up to date
- Document all public APIs
- Provide code examples
- Maintain CHANGELOG for all releases
