Based on the implementation plan provided in the TODO list at "roadmaps/implementation.txt", implement as many unfinished tasks as possible in a single, cohesive update to the codebase. Focus on maintaining the project's standards: C99 compliance, modular structure with small files (<500 LOC where feasible), no global variables, clean code principles, and futuristic 3D holographic UI using Nuklear overlaid on raylib's 3D rendering. Prioritize tasks in logical order.

For each feature or task implemented:
- Add rigorous validation: Include unit tests in tests/ (expand the minimal test framework if needed), manual checks in comments, and runtime assertions/error handling to prevent regressions.
- Test for regressions: After implementation, verify that previously completed features (marked [x] in the TODO) still work as expectedâ€”e.g., re-run existing tests, check 3D rendering stability, UI responsiveness, and cross-platform compilation.
- Update the TODO list: Mark newly completed tasks as [x].

Only modify or add files as necessary; do not overwrite unrelated code. Generate complete, compilable code snippets for new/updated files. If a task requires assets (e.g., fonts, models), assume placeholders or generate procedural equivalents in code.

Output format:
- List of implemented tasks with brief descriptions.
- Validation results (e.g., "Tests passed: 5/5, no regressions detected").
- Comprehensive commit message
- Add changes to CHANGELOG.md

Compile the application and run it so I can test the new functionality.
